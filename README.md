Execute runtest to give it a go.

A demonstration API is available from http://n5test.kxml.no/api/ .
This is not quite working according to the specification available
from
https://samdok.com/leveranser/leveranser-2016/noark5-tjenestegrensesnitt-v-1-0-beta/ .

This test suite was written to test the code in
