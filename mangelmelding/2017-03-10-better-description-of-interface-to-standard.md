Beskrivelse
-----------

The interface as it currently stands lacks a proper description of what the
core and client should do in certain situations. Riksarkivet have pointed at
the standard and said the answer lies there. Some times the answer can not be
 found in the standard! There is too much left for interpretation.

 In particular, how to handle file uploads is not explained in sufficient
 detail (Own mangelmelding on this). What are the minimum fields that must
 be set by the client for a create request, as opposed to an update request.
 Which values should be set by the client, and which should be set by the
 server?

 If the interface standard is not going to include a description of such
 things, an additional document should be created that details this.

Ønsket endring
--------------

This issue needs further attention. Further work must be carried out on how
to provide adequate descriptions of expectations for both the core and client
